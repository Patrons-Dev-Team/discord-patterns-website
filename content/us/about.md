# About discord patterns

D-patterns is a free and open source projet built by a small team of IT student.
The main goal was to find something to do during the spring lockdown of 2020 in France.

It is entirely JAMStack, secure, and uses few ressources.

It was built with :

- VueJS
- NuxtJS
- Vuetify
- and many others !
